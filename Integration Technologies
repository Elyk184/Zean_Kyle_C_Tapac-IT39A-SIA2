Goal

The primary goal of this initiative was to enhance student employability by integrating Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy resources into the undergraduate cloud computing module. This partnership aimed to:

Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical, industry-relevant skills.

Equip students with AWS certifications to meet industry demands for cloud computing expertise.

Foster deeper engagement and understanding of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT).


 Role


Educational Institutions: Redesign curricula to incorporate AWS tools and resources.

AWS Academy: Provide technical expertise, hands-on labs, and certification opportunities.

Students: Actively participate in training and practical applications to build their skills.

Instructors: Facilitate learning by combining theoretical teaching with AWS-provided practical labs.


Audience


Primary: Undergraduate students enrolled in cloud computing or related programs.

Secondary:

Faculty members looking to align academic content with industry requirements.

Employers seeking skilled graduates with certifications in cloud computing.



Situation

The study addressed the increasing skills gap between academia and industry requirements in cloud computing. Key aspects of the situation included:

Rising Demand: The rapid adoption of cloud computing technologies created a need for graduates with hands-on experience.

Academic Limitation: Traditional education often lacked practical application and industry-aligned content.

Proposed Solution: A partnership with AWS Academy introduced practical labs, training resources, and certifications into the academic framework.



 Product/Performance Summary of Key Findings


• Students were more engaged and motivated when practical, real-world applications were integrated into the curriculum.

• AWS certifications significantly enhanced students' employability and competitiveness in the job market.

• The redesigned module effectively combined theoretical knowledge with practical training, improving learning outcomes.


Critical Analysis

Strengths:

• Collaboration with AWS Academy provided access to high-quality, industry-standard resources.

• Students gained practical skills that directly aligned with job market demands.

• Certification opportunities added value to students' academic achievements.


Weaknesses:

• Limited scalability due to resource requirements (e.g., AWS account setup, instructor training).

• Dependence on a single industry partner may narrow the focus of the curriculum.



Recommendations for Further Research

•  Investigate the long-term career outcomes of students who completed the AWS-integrated module.


• Explore the scalability of similar partnerships in resource-limited institutions.


• Analyze the effectiveness of combining multiple industry partnerships to diversify learning outcomes.


• Assess the feasibility of introducing similar modules in non-technical disciplines.


Conclusion

This case study highlights the importance of academia-industry collaboration in bridging the skills gap and enhancing employability. By leveraging AWS Academy resources, the redesigned cloud computing module successfully equipped students with the practical skills and certifications needed for modern industries. Future research and expansion of such partnerships can further strengthen their impact on education and employability.
